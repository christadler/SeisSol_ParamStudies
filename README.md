# SeisSol_ParamStudies

This is a bunch of generic scripts and templates 
that allows you to use SeisSol (https://github.com/SeisSol/SeisSol) for parameter studies. 
It was developed for DT-Geo (DTC-E4, Block 3) to generate 
a catalogue for AltoTiberina.

# Manual

A Manual to adapt the workflow to arbitrary parameter studies
can be found in the README directory.

# Requirements

```bash
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

# Future Developments

The next step is to use the new Geo-INQUIRE SDL to save the catalogue.
